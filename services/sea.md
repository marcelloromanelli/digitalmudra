### Our services

#### International campaigns

For international campaigns, you can't rely solely on Google: Yandex has a 62% market share in Russia, Baidu 70% in China, Yahoo 53% in Japan and Bing 33% in the US. Our experts have quality certificates from the leading international search engines. In addition to technical expertise, we also have the requisite language skills: a total of twelve languages are spoken at Webrepublic, including French, English, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Chinese. Our experts are well-versed in the subtle national differences in search behavior, making them the ideal partners for your international search engine advertising.

#### Creation

In the first step, we familiarize ourselves with your marketing strategy. We then research the search queries and keywords that indicate a concrete interest in your products and services. This enables us to write display texts that efficiently speak to your target group and set up targeting that ensures ads are being shown at the right time to the right user.

#### Optimization 
We analyze the performance of your campaign, focusing on ads that achieve the specified objectives and those that don't. This creates a foundation for the continuous optimization of your campaign, which also means more efficient use of your advertising funds.
Tracking – We implement custom tracking solutions to hone our ability to systematically evaluate your campaign. Through these solutions we gain – sometimes surprising – insights into the search and buying behavior of your customers, allowing us to optimize campaigns in an even more targeted way and focus our efforts where the effect is greatest, namely in results.
Reporting – You work with us to make the most efficient use of the internet as a communication, lead generation and sales channel. After all, you don't want to spend an unnecessary amount of time reading reports. Our single-page monthly reports cogently and transparently summarizes how your campaigns are doing and where there is room for improvement. Read more about custom reporting solutions developed by our software engineers.

#### Intelligence
Based on a campaign's performance data, we can ascertain which of the campaign's messages work especially well with your target group. That, in turn, enables us to provide valuable input on your overall marketing campaign.

#### Automation
Certain activities are repetitive and do not require the creativity and intuition of a Google Ads specialist. With the help of our in-house software engineers, such activities are handled by customized algorithms instead. That gives our specialists more time for the creative and strategic optimization of your Google Ads campaigns.

#### Synergies with SEO
We manage the two search marketing disciplines SEA and SEO in order to leverage synergies from the strategy level right down to the keyword level. Innovative metrics and interdisciplinary teams create sustainable value and successful projects.
