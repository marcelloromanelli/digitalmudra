Social media influences public opinion. That's why brands use platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and Snapchat to enter into an authentic dialogue with their fans. The successful ones are companies that know how to combine credible storytelling with the targeting capabilities of social networks. Thanks to extensive user data, social networks offer the possibility of defining highly-specific target groups and reaching them with posts and ads – increasingly outside of the social networks as well.

### Our Approach
In social media, everything revolves around the credibility of your brand. We start by gaining a strong understanding of your brand and market environment. Based on your marketing strategy, we identify the platforms that you can use effectively to achieve your goals. At the same time, we identify the specific target groups that are relevant to you. With your input, we then decide which mix of organic posts and advertising formats will most effectively promote your brand. To achieve additional synergies, we can develop an overarching strategy that combines your social media marketing and search engine marketing.
